Judging will take place in two (2) stages, as described below, with one (1) or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor. The odds of winning are based on the number of eligible entries received.  

**Stage One:** The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Project meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required technologies featured in the Hackathon.  

**Stage Two:** All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the "Judging Criteria") below, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the Judges:  

| Judging Criteria | What Judges are Looking For |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Technological Implementation (20%)** | Does the Project demonstrate quality software development practices?<br>How effectively does the Project leverage the AI Dev Days hero technologies (Microsoft Foundry, Agent Framework, Azure MCP, GitHub Copilot Agent Mode)?<br>Is the code well-structured, documented, and maintainable? |
| **Agentic Design & Innovation (20%)** | How creatively does the solution apply Agentic AI patterns?<br>Does the Project demonstrate sophisticated agent orchestration, MCP integration, or multi-agent collaboration?<br>Is the AI implementation novel, or does it meaningfully improve upon existing approaches? |
| **Real-World Impact & Applicability (20%)** | How significant is the problem being solved?<br>Could this solution be deployed in a production environment?<br>What is the potential impact on developers, businesses, or end users? |
| **User Experience & Presentation (20%)** | Is the user experience well-designed and intuitive?<br>Does the demo video clearly communicate the Project's value?<br>Is there a balanced blend of frontend and backend implementation? |
| **Adherence to Hackathon Category (20%)** | •	Does the entry comply with the description of the applicable Hackathon Category? |

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable Prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

**Tie Breaking:** For each Prize listed below, if two (2) or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two (2) or more Submissions are tied on all applicable Judging Criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.
